This C++ program, accompanied by a captivating ASCII art, showcases a pattern resembling the number "0" surrounded by zeros. The code employs the standard C++ library and leverages the "iostream" header to display this eye-catching visual on the console. It's a fun and creative example of how you can use C++ to create graphical designs using simple text characters. Additionally, the code utilizes the "system" function to set the console text and background color to an appealing combination of red (0E) for an enhanced visual experience.

Instructions:
1. Compile and run this code on your C++ development environment.
2. Observe the beautifully rendered ASCII art representing the number "0" within a frame of zeros.
3. Enjoy the aesthetic appeal of the red and yellow color scheme that enhances the presentation.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this code to create your own ASCII art or experiment with different colors and patterns to create captivating visuals using C++.
